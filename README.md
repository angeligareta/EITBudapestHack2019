Hackathon organized by [Ultrahack](https://ultrahack.org/budapesthack2019) and [OTP](https://www.otpbank.hu/portal/hu/Maganszemelyek) with the aim of finding solutions for the shortcomings of the current financial management processes of SMEs. 

## ü§î Problem statement
SMEs spend a too much time on finance administration which is time away from their core business processes ‚Äì such as sales and production. There are numerous banking and administration (accounting, invoicing, CRM etc.) solutions in the market, but operating mostly on stand alone basis. OTP eBIZ has developed a scalable platform with open APIs that allows third party players to improve and extend the functionality and therefore improve the value for SMEs. The functionalities it covers are money transfer, invoice management (issuing, registering, paying), basic financial dashboard, data export for accounting, lending and factoring. Come up with concept, demos and solutions which address the shortcomings of today‚Äôs SME finance management processes. Ideate and trial how your solution can be integrated with OTP eBIZ platform using their API.

## üè¢ Organizing company
[OTP eBIZ](https://docs.ebizplatform.com/?version=latest), a subsidiary of OTP Bank, offers value added, non-traditional banking services for SMEs by connecting on-line banking, invoicing and accounting in a cloud environment. OTP Bank is one of the biggest banks in the Central-Eastern European region offering services to more than 18 million clients in 14 countries. 

## üí° Solution

Our solution consisted of the development of a plugin for the eBiz OTP platform that reminds users of the payment of invoices and optimizes the task itself, resulting in a better credit score for customers. It achieved 2nd place in the hackathon! ü•á
